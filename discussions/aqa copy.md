# London Qualitative Community: External Event Board

This dedicated space allows our members to freely share and discover qualitative research events (conferences, workshops, seminars, and more) happening around London. 

We encourage everyone to participate by posting relevant events and sharing your experiences with others.

We hope this External Event Board serves as a valuable resource for our community, fostering engagement, knowledge-sharing, and networking opportunities among qualitative researchers in London. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy sharing and exploring!
