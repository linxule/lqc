# London Qualitative Community

![](assets/LQC.jpg)

Welcome to the official website for the London Qualitative Community (LQC)!

## About

We are a vibrant community of management scholars from across the greater London region who not only champion research using qualitative data but also help advance the tools, techniques, and methods for using qualitative data so we can have a positive impact on our organizational world.

Underlying this shared purpose is a set of founding values that we believe will help foster a positive and developmental community for our members, including open and constructive dialogue, the inclusion of diverse perspectives, an inclination toward creativity and innovation, and a focus on continuous improvement and advancement.
