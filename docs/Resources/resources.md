# London Qualitative Community Resource Lists

We have compiled resources recommended by our community members and related others that may be helpful to fellow scholars using qualitative methods. The workbook embedded below has worksheets with different resource types, from journal articles to useful websites and platforms. If you have suggestions for other resources that should be added, please message one of the steering committee members!
