# 2025-2026 Annual Research Day [Bayes Business School, 06/02/2026]

**Date:** Friday, February 6, 2026

**Time:** 9 AM - 6:00 PM GMT (9:00-18:00 GMT)

**Location:** Bayes Business School, Bunhill Row Campus (EC1Y 8TZ)

**Details:**

We had full rooms for the Annual 2026 Research Day of the London+ Qualitative Community, hosted on Friday, 6 February 2026, at Bayes Business School.

This third edition, following two successful previous events, was dedicated to bringing together qualitative researchers from across the UK to meet, discuss, and engage in rich methodological and empirical conversations.

The day included panel discussions, roundtables, networking opportunities, and paper feedback sessions. It was quite the success--we are looking forward to seeing all of you, and more, at next year's L+QC Research Day!

A big thank you on behalf of all L+QC members to the 2026 L+QC Research Day Organising Committee:

*A little more about the 2026 event:*

> All were welcome--whether you simply wished to participate in discussions or wanted to share your work. For those interested, there were two types of opportunities to present and receive feedback on ongoing research.


> The first opportunity was a Research Roundtable, which provided an opportunity to discuss early-stage research ideas with senior academics in a group format. To participate in this, interested applicants needed to submit an abstract of up to 2 pages.  
The second opportunity allowed scholars to present full works-in-progress papers, with feedback provided by senior scholars dedicated to this purpose. 


> The deadline for the Call for Papers and Abstract Submission (CFP) was Monday, 19 January 2026 at 23:59 GMT.   


> The deadline for simple registration was Friday, 23 January 2026.
