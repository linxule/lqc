**Details:**

We are delighted to announce that the Annual Research Day of the London⁺ Qualitative Community (L⁺QC) will be hosted on Friday, 6th February 2026, at Bayes Business School. The conference will be held at the Bunhill Row Campus (EC1Y 8TZ) from 9:00 - 18:00 GMT, followed by an evening networking reception.

The Research Day provides a valuable opportunity for qualitative researchers in management from across the Greater London area. The event aims not only to bring together like-minded researchers but also to foster collaborations between institutions.  

For PhD students, the day offers multiple opportunities to present research and receive constructive feedback. This includes two full paper presentation sessions, each led by senior discussants, and seven theme-based idea incubators for presenting work at the idea stage, facilitated by one to two academics.  

Previous Research Days have attracted over 100 attendees, and we are eager to build on this success.

If you have any questions about the event, please don't hesitate to reach out to the event Organising Committee. We hope to see you there!
Best Wishes,
