**Details:**

We are delighted to announce that the Annual Research Day of the London+ Qualitative Community will take place on Friday, 6 February 2026, at Bayes Business School, Bunhill Row Campus (EC1Y 8TZ), from 9:00 to 18:00 GMT.

This third edition, following two successful previous events, is dedicated to bringing together qualitative researchers from across the UK to meet, discuss, and engage in rich methodological and empirical conversations.

The day will include panel discussions, roundtables, networking opportunities, and paper feedback sessions.

Everyone is welcome--whether you simply wish to participate in discussions or would like to share your work. For those interested, there will be two opportunities to present and receive feedback on ongoing research.

The first opportunity is a Research Roundtable, which provides an opportunity to discuss early-stage research ideas with senior academics in a group format. To participate in this, interested applicants need to submit an abstract of up to 2 pages.  
The second opportunity allows scholars to present full works-in-progress papers, with feedback provided by senior scholars dedicated to this purpose. In total, eight papers will be selected. 
To  register for the day to simply engage in discussion and networking or to submit either the abstract or your paper, please use this link:
