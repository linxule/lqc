# Presenting Qualitative Research [Bayes Business School, 17/06/2024]

**Date:** Monday, June 17, 2024

**Time:** 2 PM - 6 PM

**Location:** Bayes Business School, 106 Bunhill Row [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bayes+Business+School/@51.5220735,-0.0899882,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfd1b0cbf95ef2e61?sa=X&ved=1t:2428&ictx=111)
 
*How do you tackle presenting qualitative research and data within the common constraints of conference formats?*

Limits of time and slide space provide similar challenges for presenting as for writing up qualitative research. The richness and vastness of the data require a fine balance of ‘showing’ and ‘telling’ to convey and convince the audience within just 10, 15 or 20 minutes. However, strategies and practices to manage this may differ greatly, and opportunities to learn from observation in conference settings are limited for early stage researchers.
 
This is why we are putting together a half-day workshop to address this topic: On Monday, June 17th, from 14:00 to 18:00, Bayes Business School is inviting PhD students who are at the stage of presenting at conferences this summer to hear and discuss experiences and ways for presenting qualitative research. In a newly developed format, our fantastic panel of faculty will unpack their process of putting together a research presentation involving various sources of qualitative data:
- Kevin Corley (Imperial)
- Joelle Evans (Bayes)
- Jen Rhymer (UCL)
- Ruben Van Werven (Bayes)
 
The event is organized in collaboration with L+QC and includes an opportunity for networking over drinks & nibbles after the workshop.
